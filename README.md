## Goodreads Books Rating Project

Welcome to this machine learning project, conducted as part of a school program.
The dataset is a curation of Goodreads books based on real user information.

The main objective of this project is to develop a model for predicting the rating of a book based on its various characteristics. Through in-depth analysis of this dataset, we explored how factors such as authors, publisher, number of pages or number of reviews influence reader's evaluations.

To achieve this goal, we first performed an exploratory data analysis first, where we cleaned and remove outliers and then we proceed to a feature engineering.
Once our features were ready, we explored machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decisions trees and random forest, and a gradient boosting algorithm.

Emphasis was also placed on evaluating and comparing these models to determine which one offers the best prediction performance.
Finally, a residual analysis were performed in order to see the weaknesses of our models.
